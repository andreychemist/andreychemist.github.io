# My story

My name is Andrey Solovyev. I studied chemistry in St. Petersburg State University, Russia in 2002-2007, and I got my PhD degree in Chemistry from the University of Pittsburgh (2007-2012). Then I worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in the F-1 OPT immigration status (practical training after getting a degree from a US university).

In summer 2012, I filed the I-140 petition under the EB1-A category as a person with extraordinary abilities in Organometallic Chemistry. I prepared it myself without help of a lawyer, and it took about a month to write the text and collect all supporting documents. I requested the premium processing (Form I-907), and my petition was approved in one week. Then I filed Form I-485 to adjust my status of non-immigrant F-1 OPT to legal permanent resident. I received my green card (I-551) in Nov. 2012. I became the naturalized US citizen in Feb 2018: 5 years and 3 months after getting the green card.

My brother got his green card under the same EB-1A category in Jun 2015. He has PhD in Mathematics and worked as a postdoc in Computer Sciences at the University of Utah at that time. Now we work together as independent software developers of educational mobile applications ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/developer/andrey-solovyev/id655223913); [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Andrey+Solovyev)).

My brother also prepared his immigration petition himself. And I want to share our experience of successful self-petitioning for green card with other people by telling our story and offering an example of the I-140 petition. In last 5 years, I sent an example of EB-1A petition to more than 250 people who contacted me by e-mail. At least 34 persons wrote me later that they self-petitioned and received approval under EB-1A or EB2-NIW categories. Most of them were also Russian-speaking scientists who already worked as postdocs in the United States. These stories inspired me to create this website where I can openly share my examples of the I-140 petition and my general observations about the US immigration laws and practices that I made during my personal immigration journey and from the conversations with other people. 

I concluded that if there are no special circumstances, a successful scientist working in the United States in a legal non-immigrant status (F-1 OPT, J-1, H1B, O-1) can apply for and get the green card without help of an immigration attorney.

## My Immigration Timeline:
- Summer 2012 - I work in the LBNL as a postdoctoral fellow in the F-1 OPT status (valid until Dec. 2012).
- 24 Jul 2012 - asked professors for recommendation letters.
- 20 Aug 2012 - filed the I-140 petition under EB-1A classification requesting premium processing (Form I-907).
- 28 Aug 2012 - received the notice about approval of I-140 petition.
- 12 Sep 2012 - filed the I-485 adjustment of status application with the medical exam Form I-693 and the request of the EAD card (Form I-765).
- 10 Oct 2012 - received the EAD card.
- 24 Oct 2012 - biometrics appointment in the USCIS office.
- 14 Nov 2012 - received my green card.
- 13 Feb 2018 - became the US citizen.

I want to emphasize that waiting times were much shorter in 2012 than they are now. In 2018, people waited for at least 4 months to get the EAD. The approval of I-140 without premium processing or the issue of a green card after filing I-485 took many months, often longer than a year. No one can predict future processing times, so plan accordingly. Until 2017, personal interviews with the USCIS officer were usually waived for EB applicants, but they are required now.
